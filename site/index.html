    <h2>What a laptop have I bought</h2>
    <p>I've bought a really cool laptop. It costs around 900$ and I haven't used
        it much because I left my country. Now I'm learning how to use GIT hub.
        Still don't get it. The task is to update the file in the GIT through command console.
    </p>

    <h3>How to update via Comman console</h3>
    <p>First you need to WRITE something NEW in your document, than you have to type in the command console
        <b>git add .</b> after that you use the command <b>git commit -m "MESSAGE"</b> this applies your changes in the <i>LOCAL GIT</i> 
    and to apply it in the internet you write the command <b>git push</b>.</p>
    <p>One thing that I've just learnt is the <b> browser-sync --server --directory --files "*" </b> this line
    allows you to aplly changes as soon as you save your documnet. Awesome isn't it?
    </p> 
    <p>But the <b>PROBLE</b> is that it doesn't show the changes in the repository!!!</p>
